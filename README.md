# Tic-Tac-Toe
A console-based application that is written in Java that represents the classic Tic Tac Toe game. 
The game provides three player types â€“ a human player, a computer player, and an advanced computer player.
Users can choose any one of these types for Player 1 and Player 2. <br/>
The command format for a player option is: <br/>
  java TicTacToe [-c [1|2]] <br/>
The "-c" option indicates computer player(s). The option "1|2" allows the user to specify which player 
will be the computer player. Omitting the "-c" option means two human players (the default mode). The "-a" 
option makes computer players take their turns with more advanced logic. Note that it is possible to win 
against a computer player, but the game with the advance computer player will always result in a tie or computer's victory.
